# calculator
A basic functional calculator made in vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript
The UI was made with HTML and CSS Flexbox, while all the logic was done in JS

This was a surprisingly tricky project for me, having to take into account all the cases
that might come up. While I feel like I succeeded in handling that, I think my code came
out messier than I hoped. I tried my best to divvy up the needed logic into their
separate functions, but their purpose is still not inherently clear.
I think my code documentation will be tested when I revisit this
in the future.
